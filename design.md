CurlGUI - API Testing Tool Specification
Overview
CurlGUI is a lightweight, open-source API testing tool built around cURL functionality. It provides a graphical interface to cURL without requiring cloud connectivity, logins, or remote storage. All data is stored locally, giving users complete control over their API testing environment.

Core Features
Local Storage Architecture
File System Storage: All requests, collections, and environments stored directly on the user's file system

Git-Friendly Format: JSON-based storage format compatible with version control systems

No Remote Dependencies: Complete functionality without internet connection

No Login Requirement: Zero authentication barriers to using the application

Request Management
HTTP Method Support: Full support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS

Collection Organization: Hierarchical organization of requests into collections and folders

Request History: Automatic tracking of recently executed requests

Request Duplication: Ability to clone and modify existing requests

Request Configuration
Custom Headers: Interface for adding, editing, and removing HTTP headers

URL Parameters: Query parameter builder with key-value pair interface

Request Body Editors:

JSON editor with syntax highlighting and validation

Form data builder (multipart/form-data and x-www-form-urlencoded)

Raw text input with content type selection

Binary file upload capability

Response Handling
Response Formatting: Automatic pretty-printing of JSON, XML, HTML responses

Syntax Highlighting: Color-coded display of response content based on type

Response Metadata: Clear display of status code, response time, size, and headers

Response History: Ability to view and compare previous responses for the same request

Environment and Variables
Environment Management: Create and switch between multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)

Variable Extraction: Extract values from responses to use in subsequent requests

Variable Substitution: Use environment variables within URLs, headers, and request bodies

Dynamic Variables: Support for auto-generated values (timestamps, UUIDs, random strings)

Import/Export Capabilities
cURL Command Export: Generate equivalent cURL commands for any request

cURL Command Import: Parse cURL commands to create requests

Collection Import/Export: Exchange collections with other users via JSON files

Format Compatibility: Import/export compatibility with common formats (Postman, Insomnia)

Developer Experience
Request Chaining: Create sequences of dependent requests

Pre-request Scripts: Simple scripting to prepare request data

Post-response Scripts: Process response data automatically

Request Validation: Verify responses against expected schemas or values

User Interface
Dark/Light Themes: Visual preference options

Split View: Simultaneous display of request and response

Tabs Interface: Work with multiple requests simultaneously

Keyboard Shortcuts: Efficiency-focused keyboard navigation

Technical Implementation
Architecture
Frontend: Modern web technologies (React/Vue/Svelte) for the UI

Backend: Lightweight local server to execute cURL commands

Storage: File system-based JSON storage for persistence

Packaging: Electron or similar for cross-platform desktop distribution

Performance Goals
Startup Time: Application launches in under 2 seconds

Memory Usage: Less than 200MB RAM consumption during normal operation

Response Handling: Support for large responses (10MB+) without UI freezing

Security Considerations
Local-only Operation: No data transmission to remote servers

Certificate Handling: Support for custom CA certificates and self-signed certificates

Sensitive Data: Option to mask sensitive headers or parameters in logs and exports

User Experience Flow
User opens application and sees dashboard with recent requests and collections

User creates a new request by selecting HTTP method and entering URL

User configures request details (headers, parameters, body)

User executes request and views formatted response

User can save request to collection, export as cURL, or chain to another request

All actions are persisted locally without requiring internet connectivity

Extensibility
Plugin Architecture: Support for community-developed extensions

Custom Themes: User-definable UI themes

Scripting API: Documented API for automation and extensions

Command Line Interface: Ability to trigger saved requests from terminal

This specification outlines a powerful yet lightweight alternative to cloud-based API testing tools, focusing on developer privacy, local control, and the core functionality needed for effective API testing.
