# Antiposta Test Server

This is a simple Python HTTP server designed to test the Antiposta API testing tool. The server echoes back information about the request and responds with the appropriate content type based on the request.

## Features

- Supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)
- Content negotiation based on Accept header or request Content-Type
- Responds with appropriate format (JSON, HTML, XML, or plain text)
- CORS enabled for testing from any origin
- Echoes back all request details (headers, parameters, body, etc.)
- Handles different body formats (JSON, form data, XML, plain text)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Usage

1. Start the server:

```bash
python test_server.py [port]
```

The default port is 8000 if not specified.

2. Use Antiposta to send requests to the server:

```
http://localhost:8000/any/path/you/want
```

## Testing Different Content Types

### JSON

Send a request with Content-Type: application/json or Accept: application/json header to get a JSON response.

Example in Antiposta:
- Set the URL to: http://localhost:8000/api/test
- Add a header: Content-Type: application/json
- Set the body type to JSON and add some JSON content:
```json
{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com"
}
```

### HTML

Send a request with Accept: text/html header to get an HTML response.

Example in Antiposta:
- Set the URL to: http://localhost:8000/page
- Add a header: Accept: text/html

### XML

Send a request with Content-Type: application/xml or Accept: application/xml header to get an XML response.

Example in Antiposta:
- Set the URL to: http://localhost:8000/api/xml
- Add a header: Accept: application/xml

### Form Data

Send a request with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data to test form submissions.

Example in Antiposta:
- Set the URL to: http://localhost:8000/submit-form
- Set the body type to Form Data
- Add key-value pairs for your form fields

## Query Parameters

You can add query parameters to test URL parameter handling:

Example:
```
http://localhost:8000/search?q=test&page=1
```

## Response

The server will respond with details about your request, including:

- HTTP method used
- Request path
- HTTP version
- All request headers
- Query parameters
- Request body (if any)
- Client IP address
- Timestamp
- Server name

This makes it easy to verify that your Antiposta client is correctly sending the request as intended.
