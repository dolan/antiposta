### üü° Optional Convenience Features
- [ ] **Simple Collections** - Optional save/load to file (graceful when empty)
- [ ] **cURL Import** - Parse cURL commands to create requests
- [ ] **Multi-tab Support** - Work with 2-3 requests simultaneously for comparison
- [ ] **Request Duplication** - Quick copy current request to new tab

### üìÅ File Operations (Optional)
- [ ] **Export Collections** - Save requests to local file
- [ ] **Import Collections** - Load requests from local file
- [ ] **Environment Export** - Share environment configs via file

### ‚ö° Performance Enhancements
- [ ] **Dynamic Variables** - Auto-generated timestamps, UUIDs for testing
- [ ] **Variable Extraction** - Grab values from responses for next requests

### ‚úÖ Foundation (Already Solid)
- [x] **No Remote Dependencies** - Complete functionality without internet connection
- [x] **Fast Startup** - Loads instantly in browser
- [x] **Lightweight** - Single-file application
- [x] **Responsive Design** - CSS grid and flexbox layout
- [x] **Help System** - Comprehensive help overlay

## Removed from Scope (Keeping it Light)

### ‚ùå Complex Workflow Features (Not Essential)
- **Request Chaining** - Adds complexity, developers can handle manually
- **Pre/post Scripts** - Over-engineering for quick API testing
- **Request Validation** - Can validate responses manually
- **Split View** - Nice but not essential for speed
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Low priority cosmetic feature
- **Response History** - Simple recent list is sufficient
- **Binary File Upload** - Edge case, can use curl directly for files
- **Advanced Collection Management** - Keep it simple: save/load files only

### ‚ùå Integration Complexity (Not Core)
- **Postman/Insomnia Import** - Format compatibility adds complexity
- **Git Integration** - Files are already git-friendly
- **Complex Authentication** - OAuth2 covers most needs

## Current Status Summary

### üéØ **Ready for Production Use: 95%**
The essential curl-style functionality is **complete and working**:
- All HTTP methods with full request configuration
- Environment variables with interpolation  
- OAuth2 authentication
- Clean, fast interface
- Comprehensive help system

### üöÄ **Recently Completed High-Impact Features:**
1. ‚úÖ **cURL Export** - Copy request as curl command (Ctrl+K)
2. ‚úÖ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Ctrl+Enter to send, Ctrl+L for URL focus, F1 for help
3. ‚úÖ **Simple History** - Clickable recent requests in sidebar

### üéØ **Next Features for Additional Value:**
1. **Simple Collections** - Save/load requests to file
2. **Multi-tab Support** - Work with 2-3 requests simultaneously  
3. **Dynamic Variables** - Auto-generated timestamps, UUIDs

### üìà **Success Metrics vs Design Goals:**
- **‚úÖ Quick API Testing**: Loads instantly, zero setup required
- **‚úÖ Lighter than Postman**: Single file, no bloat, fast startup  
- **‚úÖ Curl-style Useful**: All essential HTTP functionality present
- **‚úÖ No Login Friction**: Works immediately with no barriers
- **‚úÖ Local Control**: Everything stored locally, privacy maintained

**The app already delivers on its core promise - it's a lighter, faster alternative to Postman for quick API testing.**
